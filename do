# Bootstrap script, so we can build and test redo using (mostly) redo.
# Before redo is available, we have to use minimal/do to build it.  After
# that, we switch to real redo.
#
# NOTE: Don't use this as a model for your own redo projects!  It's friendly
# to provide a 'do' script at the top of your project for people who haven't
# installed redo, but that script is usually just a copy of minimal/do,
# because your project probably doesn't have the same bootstrap problem that
# redo itself does.
